    "## Introduction\n",
    "As we defined in __Discrete Random Variables__, a _discrete_ random variable takes only a countable number of values. A _continuous_ random variable, however, has a range defined as an interval or a union of non-overlapping intervals on the real line. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the methods used to describe and analyse _discrete_ random variables are usually not suited to describe or analyse _continuous_. Simply said, if you replace instances of _sums_ with _integrals_, and _PMFs_ with _PDFs_, these methods work again."
